         <p>
            Hey, I'm Vincent, and I love tech! Programming has been a big hobby
            of mine since my teenage years, and I hope to put my talents to good
            use. I have confidence in the entirety of full-stack development,
            whether that be the front-end user experience, or the back-end
            server optimization. Below, you will find my various projects,
            including my schoolwork and even some of my hobby work.
